## Data Description
To show an understanding of the dataset, the data description is shown below:

## Mockup draft
Based on the report requirements, a draft of the report was thoughtful created (_shown below_) as a guide in the course of building the report.

## ETL
Power BI desktop was launched and connected to Excel workshop as that is the format of the dataset. Lots of transformation process was carried out such:
- Checked all the tables, rows and columns to ensure consistent formatting, no missing values and duplicate values. 
- Used first row as header on DimLocations table
- Merged querries (DimChannel and DimSubChannel)
- Appended querries (Sales2022 and Sales2023-2025)
- Unpivoted the year columns in Taget table 
- Unabled data load of Sales2022 table and DimChannels
  
After these, I closed and applied settings to start analysis

## Modelling
Power BI automatically creates relationships between the tables. However, I looked through it and made a few adjustments to make it a STAR schema (_shown below_) with 5 dimension tables and 2 fact tables. I also created a calendar table using DAX measures which I linked to the model as well.

Below shows the specific column column the tables are connected to (Relationship)

## DAX measures calculations
The following measures were calculated to aid my analysis.

## Conclusion
The goal of this report is to have a dashboard to that will guide strategies, tactics and operations as acompany.
- The Sales Representative can track their performances through-out the periods to plan their marketing activities.
- The Team Managers can track their teams' performances through-out the periods to plan their teams' activities.
